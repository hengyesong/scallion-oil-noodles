            <h2>WHAT ARE SCANLLION OIL NOODLES</h2>
            Scallion oil noodles are a humble dish originating in Shanghai. In appearance, it’s as simple as can be: 
            boiled noodles coated  with a shiny, brown sauce, and topped with fried scallions. 
            Yet, this dish can effortlessly excite your taste buds, a true example 
            to prove the concept of “Less is more” The key flavors of the dish come 
            from scallions and soy sauce. These two basic ingredients play star roles in 
            many popular Chinese recipes, such as Scallion Oil Chicken, Scallion Pork Chops, 
            Scallion Ginger Salmon, Scallion Tofu, and more.
            Thanks to a short list of ingredients and simple preparation, this dish makes an
             incredibly beginner-friendly dish that I encourage everyone to try.
