            <h2>WHAT ARE SCANLLION OIL NOODLES</h2>
            Scallion oil noodles are a humble dish originating in Shanghai. In appearance, it‚Äôs as simple as can be: 
            boiled noodles coated  with a shiny, brown sauce, and topped with fried scallions. 
            Yet, this dish can effortlessly excite your taste buds, a true example 
            to prove the concept of ‚ÄúLess is more‚Äù The key flavors of the dish come 
            from scallions and soy sauce. These two basic ingredients play star roles in 
            many popular Chinese recipes, such as Scallion Oil Chicken, Scallion Pork Chops, 
            Scallion Ginger Salmon, Scallion Tofu, and more.
            Thanks to a short list of ingredients and simple preparation, this dish makes an
             incredibly beginner-friendly dish that I encourage everyone to try.

                    <div class="steps"><h3>Step 1: cut the scallions</h3>
                        Rinse the scallions thoroughly and dry them with kitchen paper. 
                        Remove the root ends and slice them into long sections, 
                        then split each piece lengthways. <br>üåü TIP: There is no need 
                        to chop the scallion too finely, as this can cause them to burn 
                        quickly in the oil. </div>
                    <div class="steps"><h3>Step 2: infuse the oil</h3>
                        Add oil to a wok or a skillet, then put in the scallions. 
                        Fry them on a gentle medium-low heat.When the white part of the 
                        scallions turns a golden brown shade, remove them and set aside. 
                        Leave the infused oil in the wok. <br>
                        üåü TIP: During this process, pay close attention not to burn the scallions.

                    </div>
                    <div class="steps"><h3>Step 3: make the sauce</h3>
                        Turn off the heat and let the scallion-infused oil cool for a minute. 
                        Then add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sugar. Stir to combine. 
                        The remaining heat of the oil should be sufficient to make the sauce 
                        bubble and fully dissolve the sugar. <br>
                        üåü TIP: If the oil has become too cold, turn on the heat for a short 
                        period of time to simmer the sauce.</div>
                    <div class="steps"><h3>Step 4: cook the noodles</h3>
                        To save time, boil the noodles simultaneously on another burner as 
                        you prepare the sauce. Follow the recommended cooking time on the package,
                         or give them a taste if unsure about the doneness. <br>
                        üåü TIP: If you‚Äôd like to add some leafy greens to the dish (e.g. bok choy, spinach), put them into the same pot to cook right before the noodles are done.</div>
                    <div class="steps"><h3>Step 5: assemble the dish</h3>
                        Transfer the drained noodles to the wok, mixing them thoroughly with the 
                        sauce to ensure an even coating.Dish out the sauced noodles to individual 
                        serving bowls or a large plate for sharing. Then garnish with the golden-brown 
                        fried scallions.</div>

        <div class="leftnotes"><h4>üåüNotes</h4>

            1. Apart from the traditional choice of Chinese wheat noodles, feel free to use rice noodles, soba noodles, or even Italian spaghetti. <br>
            2. If the oil isn‚Äôt hot enough and no bubbles appear when you pour in soy sauce and sugar, turn on the heat to heat up briefly. <br>    
            3. You can make the sauce in a big batch and store it in the fridge for 1 month. However, the fried scallions need to be consumed in 3 days.
